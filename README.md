# TaxLens

### AI-powered Financial Document Intelligence

TaxLens is an AI-powered financial document analysis platform that enables users to upload financial PDFs such as invoices, receipts, payroll statements, and tax-related documents for instant AI-driven analysis.

Using modern Large Language Models through OpenRouter, TaxLens extracts structured financial information, generates concise summaries, identifies potential risks, and provides actionable recommendations through a modern dashboard.

This project was built as a submission for the **SignalsHQ Frontend Engineer Internship Challenge** to demonstrate product thinking, AI integration, modern frontend engineering, clean backend architecture, and professional UI/UX.
